# Movie-Recommendation-System
The notebook explores and compares three recommendation techniques:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering – recommends movies by finding users with similar tastes.

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering – suggests movies similar to the ones a user has liked.

Random Walk (Graph-Based) – uses a Pixie-inspired random walk on a user-movie graph to generate recommendations.
